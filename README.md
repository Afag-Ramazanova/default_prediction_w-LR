# Loan Default Probability 📊

## Project Overview 🌟
Binary logistic regression can help banks assess credit risk. Project's aim to show you a sample to create a logistic regression model and classify customers as good or bad according to their probability of default measure.

## Problem definition
Calculating the probability that a borrower defaults on loan (or credit card).

## Dependent Variable
“Bad Flag” – it is dependent binary variable having values 1 and 0. 1 refers to bad customers and 0 refers to
good customers. Bad customers mostly are customers who defaulted in payment.


## Technologies Used 💻

* Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling 🐍.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis 📊.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization 🎨.
* Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and preprocessing techniques 🛠️.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🧐
* Optbinning package to bin the variables based on their event rates. Link for detailed explanation: http://gnpalencia.org/optbinning/

## Performance metrics
The evaluation metric for this problem is ROC AUC and the GINI coefficient.
